Roles documentation
===================

*provy* is basically divided in two namespaces: :doc:`provy.core </api/provy.core>` and :doc:`provy.more </api/provy.more>`. It is divided like this to make it easier to find the roles you need.

:doc:`provy.core </api/provy.core>` features the code that actually makes *provy* run, like the console app or the base Role.

:doc:`provy.more </api/provy.more>` features every single specialized role that helps users in provisioning servers, like *NginxRole* or *AptitudeRole*.
