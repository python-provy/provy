Ideas, features or suggestions
==============================

If you have any ideas that can improve *provy*, or feature requests or even just some suggestion on the library or on this website, please let us know! We value your opinion more than anything else. If you don't have the time to contribute to the project, contribute with your ideas.

We have setup an easy-to-use way of providing feedback with the help of the nice people at `uservoice.com <http://www.uservoice.com/>`_.

You can go to our `uservoice.com <http://www.uservoice.com/>`_ page at http://provy.uservoice.com and vote in the ideas given by users, thus helping us select ideas that will be implemented first.

Or you can just click on the button in the right-bottom of the screen that says *feedback & support* and tell us any number of things you think will help the project.

In the event that you not only want to send us your idea, but want to implement it and contribute to the project, keep reading the Contributing section.
