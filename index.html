            <h2 class="title">What's provy and provisioning</h2>
            <div class="intro-container">
                <p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisioning">Wikipedia</a>, provisioning is "the
                process of preparing and equipping a network to allow it to provide
                (new) services to its users".</p>
                <p>We'll draw from this concept the part of preparing and
                equipping.</p>
                <p><em>provy</em> is a infrastructure provisioning automation tool.
                It's main goal is making it easy to create highly-scalable
                architectures with simple scripts.</p>
                <p><em>provy</em> stands on the shoulder of giants! <a
                    href="http://fabfile.org" title="Fabric is a Python library and command-line tool for streamlining the use of SSH for application deployment or systems administration tasks">fabric</a> for the networking part and <a

                    for templating capabilities.</p>

                <p>A very simple, yet working example of a valid <em>provyfile.py</em>:</p>

            <a name="installing"></a>
            <h2 class="title">Installing provy</h2>
            <p>Before installing provy you will need to ensure you have swig
            installed, as m2crypto needs it. Here is how to install it in
            some platforms.<p>

            <p><em>MacOSX</em></p>

            <p>To install swig on a mac, the easiest way is to install using the
            <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">homebrew package manager</a>
            (which we will not cover here). After installing it, execute this command:
            </p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/1066364.js?file=install_swig_mac.sh"></script>
            <p>Just ensure that you have <em>/usr/local/bin</em> on your path.</p>

            <p><em>Arch Linux</em></p>

            <p>Swig is in the extra repository and can be installed with:<p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/1066392.js?file=gistfile1.bash"></script>

            <p><em>Ubuntu and Debian GNU/Linux</em></p>

            <p>It is just an apt-get install away =)<p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/1066406.js?file=gistfile1.txt"></script>

            <p><em>Other platforms</em></p>
            <p>If your platform is not listed above, try searching in your package
            manager for <em>swig</em> and install it given the search results.</p>

            <p><em>Install provy</em></p>

            <p>Now that you have <em>swig</em>, installing <em>provy</em> is as easy as:</p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/1061888.js?file=gistfile1.txt"></script>
            <p>It can be easily installed from source as well,
            like this:</p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/1061894.js"></script>

            <p>As can be seen above, after being installed
            a <em>provy</em> command becomes available</p>

            <p><em>provy</em> is <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software">FOSS</a>
            and you can find it's source code at <a href="https://github.com/heynemann/provy">its github page</a>.</p>

            <a name="getting-started"></a>
            <h2 class="title">Getting started</h2>
            <p>Starting to provision servers with
            <em>provy</em> is extremely simple. We'll provision a fairly
            scalable infrastructure (yet simple) for a <a href="http://tornadoweb.org">Tornado</a> website.</p>
            <p><a href="http://tornadoweb.org">Tornado</a> is
            facebook's python web server. It features non-blocking I/O and is
            extremely fast.</p>

            <h3>The solution</h3>
            <p>Below you can see a diagram of our solution:</p>
            <img class="auto-center diagram" src="images/provy_sample.png" alt="Architecture for our
            solution" />
            <p>Our solution will feature a front-end server
            with <a href="http://www.nginx.org">one nginx instance</a> doing
            the load-balancing among the <a
                href="http://tornadoweb.org">tornado</a> instances in our back-end
            server.</p>
            <p>The back-end server will feature 4 <a href="http://tornadoweb.org">tornado</a> instances kept alive
            by <a href="http://supervisord.org/">supervisor</a> (a process monitoring tool).</p>

            <p>Create a file called <em>website.py</em> at some
            directory with this contents:</p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/1061912.js?file=website.py"></script>

            <p>Yes, it is not a very involved example, but
            <em>Hello World</em> suffices for our purposes. This python
            application takes a port as command-line argument and can
            be run with:</p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/1061912.js?file=running"></script>

            <h3>The servers</h3>
            <p>Ok, now that we have a functioning application,
            let's deploy it to production.</p>
            <p>First, let's create a local "production" environment using <a
                href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>. Using <a
                href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> is beyond the scope
            of this tutorial.</p>
            <p>First make sure you have the <em>base</em> box installed. If you
            don't, use:</p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/1061912.js?file=vagrant-command"></script>

            <p>In the same directory that we created the website.py
            file, type:</p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/1061912.js?file=vagrant-init"></script>
            <p>This will create a file called VagrantFile. This is the file
            that configures our <a href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>
            instances. Open it up in your editor of choice and change it to
            read:</p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/4505288.js?file=VagrantFile"></script>
            <p>Ok, now when we run vagrant we'll have two servers up:
            33.33.33.33 and 33.33.33.34. The first one will be our front-end
               server and the latter our back-end server.</p>

            <h3>Provisioning file</h3>
            <p>It's now time to start provisioning our servers. In the same
            directory that we created the <em>website.py</em> file, let's create a file
            called <em>provyfile.py</em>.</p>

            <p>The first thing we'll do in this file is importing the <em>provy</em>
            classes we'll use. We'll also define <em>FrontEnd</em> and
            <em>BackEnd</em> roles and assign them to our two vagrant servers.</p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/1061912.js?file=provyfile.py"></script>

            <p>Even though our script does not actually provision anything yet,
            let's stop to see some interesting points of it.</p>

            <p>You can see that our roles (<em>FrontEnd</em> and
            <em>BackEnd</em>) both inherit from <em>provy.Role</em>. This is
            needed so that these roles can inherit a lot of functionality
            needed for interacting with our servers.</p>

            <p>Another thing to notice is the <em>servers</em> dictionary. This
            is where we tell <em>provy</em> how to connect to each server and
            what roles does it have.</p>

            <p>We can run this script (even if it won't do anything) with:</p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/1061912.js?file=running-provy-file"></script>

            <h3>Provisioning the back-end server</h3>
            <p>Let's start working in our back-end server, since our front-end
            server depends on it to run.</p>
            <p>First we'll make sure we are running our app under our own user
            and not root:</p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/1061912.js?file=provyfile2.py"></script>

            <p>Then we'll need to copy the <em>website.py</em> file to the
            server. <em>provy</em> can easily copy files to the servers, as
            long as it can find them. Just move the <em>website.py</em> file to a directory
            named <em>files</em> in the same directory as <em>provyfile.py</em>.</p>

            <p>Now we can easily copy it to the <em>/home/frontend</em> directory:</p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/4505288.js?file=provyfile3.py"></script>

            <p>The <em>update_file</em> method tells provy to compare the
            source and target files and if they are different update the target
            file. For more information check the documentation.</p>

            <p>Next we must make sure <a
                href="http://tornadoweb.org">Tornado</a> is installed.
            <em>provy</em> already comes with a role that does that:</p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/4547217.js?file=provyfile4.py"></script>

            <p>Now all we have to do is instruct supervisor to run four
            instances of our app:</p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/4547217.js?file=provyfile5.py"></script>

            <h3>Provisioning the front-end server</h3>
            <p>Ok, now let's get our front-end up and running. <em>provy</em>
            comes with an <a href="http://www.nginx.org">nginx</a> module, so it is pretty easy configuring it.</p>

            <p>We have to provide template files for both <em>nginx.conf</em>
            and our website's site. Following what <a
                href="http://tornadoweb.org">Tornado</a>'s documentation
            instructs, these are good templates:</p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/1061953.js?file=nginx.conf"></script>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/1061953.js?file=website"></script>

            <p>Save them as <em>files/nginx.conf</em> and
            <em>files/website</em>, respectively.</p>

            <p>Now all that's left is making sure that <em>provy</em>
            configures our front-end server:</p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/4547217.js?file=provyfile6.py"></script>
            <p>See how we passed the user name as an option to the
            <em>nginx.conf</em> template? <em>provy</em> allows this kind of
            template interaction in many places. For more information, check the
            documentation.</p>

            <h3>Running and verifying it works</h3>
            <p>We can now fire our brand new infrastructure and check that the
            website is working:</p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/1061953.js?file=running%20the%20website"></script>
            <p>After these 3 commands finished running (it might take a long
            time depending on your connection speed), you should see <em>Hello
            World</em> as the result of the curl command.</p>

            <a name="runtime-arguments"></a>
            <h2 class="title">provyfile and Runtime Arguments</h2>
            <p>
                <em>provy</em> uses a python module called <em>provyfile.py</em> in order
                to retrieve the definitions of your roles, servers and the relationships
                between them.
            </p>
            <p><img src="images/provyfile.png" class="provyfile-image" alt="Sample provyfile.py with explanation." title="Sample provyfile.py with explanation." /></p>
            <p>
            This is the overall structure of a <em>provy</em> provisioning file. The first imports will be very similar among most your provyfile.py files. You'll always import <em>Role</em> and most of the time will use one of the other built-in roles.
            </p>
            <p>After the imports, come your <em>Role Definitions</em>. This is where you'll specify how you want your servers to be built. You can find more about how to build roles in the <a href="#what-are-roles">What are roles?</a> and <a href="#using-roles">Using Roles in my Roles</a> sections.</p>
            <p>Last but not least, you describe your servers and how they relate to roles. This brings us to the <em>AskFor</em> parameter (<em>provy.core.AskFor</em>). This class allows you to specify that a given option for a given server should be filled at runtime, either by passing in the command line or by asking the user doing the provisioning.</p>
            <p><em>AskFor</em> takes two arguments: <em>key</em> and <em>question</em>. The <em>key</em> argument is needed to allow passing the argument when running provy (more on that in the next section). The <em>question</em> is used when <em>provy</em> asks the user running it for the parameter.</p>
            <p><em>AskFor</em> is really useful for sensitive data such as passwords. You don't want to expose this data in your provyfile in plain text. You just use an <em>AskFor</em> parameter for it and supply the information at runtime. Let's look at a sample of AskFor usage.</p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/1061953.js?file=askfor.py"></script>
            <p>This parameter can be supplied twofold: if you don't specify it in the console when calling <em>provy</em>, you will be asked for it. If you need to specify it in the console, just use it's key like this:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
        provy -s server -p password mysql-db-password=somepass

            <a name="running"></a>
            <h2 class="title">Running provy</h2>
            <p><em>provy</em> comes with a console runner. It's the same one we
            used in the <em>Getting Started</em> tutorial.</p>
            <p>The console runner supports some options. For more information
            you can use the --help command. You should see output like the
            following:</p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/1061953.js?file=provy-help"></script>
            <p>The option you are most likely to use is the <em>server</em>
            option. It tells <em>provy</em> what servers you want provisioned.</p>
            <p>As we saw in the <a href="#runtime-arguments">provyfile and Runtime Arguments</a> section, we can also supply <em>AskFor</em> arguments when running <em>provy</em>.</p>
            <p>All arguments must take the form of key=value, with no spaces. The key must be exactly the same as the one in the <em>AskFor</em> definition, case-sensitive.</p>

            <a name="what-are-roles"></a>
            <h2 class="title">What are Roles?</h2>
            <p>Roles are the most important concept in <em>provy</em>. A role
            specifies one server capability, like user management or a package
            provider.</p>
            <p><em>provy</em> comes with many bundled roles, but you can very
            easily create your own roles. As a matter of fact, if you followed
            the <em>Getting Started</em> tutorial, you have already created two
            custom roles.</p>
            <p>Creating new roles is as easy as creating a class that inherits
            from <em>provy.Role</em> and implements a <em>provision</em> method.</p>
            <p>This method is the one <em>provy</em> will call when this role
            is being provisioned into a given server.</p>

            <a name="using-roles"></a>
            <h2 class="title">Using Roles in my Role</h2>
            <p>As you may have noticed, <em>provy</em> provides a special
            syntax for using other roles in your role. Say we need to use the
            <em>AptitudeRole</em> in our role. This is how we'd do it:</p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/1061953.js?file=using-roles.py"></script>
            <p>The <em>using</em> method of the Role class is a special way of
            using other roles. The reason for using it is that it maintains
            context and the <em>provy</em> lifecycle (more on both later).</p>
            <p>If you just want to provision another role in your role, you can
            use:</p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/1061953.js?file=using-roles-2.py"></script>
            <p>The <em>provision_role</em> method does exactly the same as the
            <em>using</em> method, except it does not enter a with block. This
            should be used when you don't wnat to call anything in the role,
            instead just have it provisioned.</p>

            <a name="templating"></a>
            <h2 class="title">Custom Files and Templating</h2>
            <p>Some methods provided by provy (including <em>update_file</em>) support
            passing in options that may be used in templates.</p>
            <p><em>provy</em> uses <a
                href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/" title="jinja2 - python templating engine">jinja2</a> for
                templating, thus supporting if/else statements, loops and much more. It's advised
                that you take a look at <a
                href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/" title="jinja2 - python templating engine">jinja2</a>
                docs.
            </p>
            <p><a
                href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/" title="jinja2 - python templating engine">jinja2</a> will
                look for files in two different places. The first one and probably the one you'll use the most,
                is a directory called <em>files</em> in the same path as <em>provyfile.py</em>.</p>
            <p>Any files you place inside this directory may be used as templates to be uploaded to the server
            being provisioned. Since <em>provy</em> is built on top of <a
                href="http://fabfile.org" title="Fabric is a Python library and command-line tool for streamlining the use of SSH for application deployment or systems administration tasks">fabric</a>, you can use it's <em>put</em> method as well to put any file or folder to the server. It's advised to use the bundled methods that come with provy, though, as those are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence">idempotent</a>.</p>
            <p>The other place you can put files is in a <em>templates</em> directory inside Role apps. The supervisor role uses this approach, if you want to take a look at an example. If you do place files in the <em>templates</em> directory, do not forget to call the <em>register_template_loader</em> method passing in the full namespace of your app (more details in the provy.more section below).</p>
            <p>We used custom files in the <em>Getting Started</em> section to provide the needed configuration files for <a href="http://www.nginx.org">nginx</a>.</p>
            <a name="core-and-more"></a>
            <h2 class="title">provy.core and provy.more</h2>
            <p>
                <em>provy</em> is divided in two namespaces: <em>provy.core</em> and <em>provy.more</em>. It is divided like this to make it easier to find the roles you need.
            </p>
            <p><em>provy.core</em> features the code that actually makes <em>provy</em> run, like the console app or the base Role.</p>
            <p><em>provy.more</em> features every single specialized role that helps users in provisioning servers, like <em>NginxRole</em> or <em>AptitudeRole</em>.</p>
            <p>Both will be documented here, even though you are advised to take a look at the code, since the docs might not be up-to-date yet.</p>
